# 🚀 C# Instruction-Tuning Pipeline with StarCoder2-15B

This project adapts the [StarCoder2 Self-Alignment pipeline](https://github.com/bigcode-project/starcoder2-self-align) to the **C# programming language**, using **Stack v2** as the code source. The objective is to build a dataset of high-quality instruction-response pairs for fine-tuning instruction-following large language models such as [StarCoder2-15B](https://huggingface.co/bigcode/starcoder2-15b).

## 📌 Project Overview

### 🎯 Goal

To generate a C#-specific instruction-tuning dataset by:
- Extracting clean and useful functions from Stack v2.
- Converting them into natural language commands and instructions.
- Using an LLM to generate accurate, aligned responses.
- Validating responses to retain only high-quality pairs.

## 🛠️ Pipeline Components

### 1. Seed Dataset Curation

- Filtered C# code snippets from Stack v2 using language metadata.
- Removed duplicates using SHA1 hashing.
- Applied structural filtering via Tree-sitter to retain only functions with meaningful `return` values.
- Output: `seed.parquet` file with 1,942 unique entries, each with an `id` and `seed` field.

### 2. Self-OSS-Instruct Pipeline

Implemented as a multi-step transformation process:
- **S → C (Seed → Command):**  
  Generated a concise natural language command describing the code’s purpose.
- **C → I (Command → Instruction):**  
  Rephrased the command into a full user-style instruction (e.g., “Write a function to…”).
- **I → R (Instruction → Response):**  
  Used StarCoder2-15B (via a vLLM API) to generate accurate C# responses for each instruction.

### 3. Self-Validation

- Automatically checked that each generated response aligns with the given instruction.
- Used heuristics such as structural checks, output presence, and syntax validity.
- Ensured only consistent and useful instruction-response pairs were retained.
