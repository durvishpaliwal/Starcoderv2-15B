# Starcoderv2-15B
This project adapts the StarCoder2 Self-Alignment pipeline to the C# programming language, using Stack v2 as the code source. The objective is to build a dataset of high-quality instruction-response pairs for fine-tuning instruction-following large language models such as StarCoder2-15B.
